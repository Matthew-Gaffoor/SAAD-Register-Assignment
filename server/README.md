First install MongoDB and MongoDB compass and Docker desktop

Using the following code enter that code into command prompt then open your docker desktop to see that a new mongodb is set up under the name mongodb
docker run --name mongodb -d -p 27017:27017 mongo

Mongo compass should also show this database under the localhost port 27017
then your mongodb is setup properly
